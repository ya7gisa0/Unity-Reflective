# Unity-Reflection-Probe-Study
Many tutorials about Unity's reflection probe out there such as [this one on YouTube](https://t.co/H3hrkWIJPI). I just wanted to make sure if I could make something interesting to see by applying this kind of reflection. Reflective materials could make your games/artworks visually better certainly. Those materials do not necessarily have to be metallic. Rubber-like materials come to mind.
